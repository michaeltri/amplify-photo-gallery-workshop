### Creating a React app
We'll get things started by building a new React web app using the **create-react-app** CLI tool. 

{{% notice info %}}
This will give us a sample React app with a local auto-reloading web server and some helpful transpiling support for the browser like letting us use async/await keywords, arrow functions, and more.

**In the Cloud9 terminal, run** `npx create-react-app photoalbums`.

**Then, navigate to the newly created directory with** `cd photoalbums`.


### Adding Semantic UI React

Before we start writing our UI, we'll also include Semantic UI components for React to give us components that will help make our interface look a bit nicer.

**In the photoalbums directory, run** 

```sh
npm install --save aws-amplify aws-amplify-react @reach/router uuid semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
```
Then, **edit public/index.html** and add this stylesheet link:

```html
<head>
    <!-- ... --> 

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.3.3/semantic.min.css"></link>

    <!-- ... --> 
</head>
```

### Starting the App
Now let's start our development server so we can make changes and see them refreshed live in the browser.

**In the photoalbums directory, run** `npm start`. 

Once the web server has started, click the **Preview** menu and **select Preview Running Application**

If you'd like, you can also **pop the preview to a new window**:

![pop app to new window](/images/pop_browser_new_window.png)

Finally, **open another terminal window**. We'll leave this first terminal alone since it's running the web server process.

### Simplifying markup

Next, we'll want to start with a clean slate.

**Edit src/App.js** and change it to display a simple 'Hello World' message. **Replace the existing content of the file with**:

```jsx
// src/App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Header } from 'semantic-ui-react';

class App extends Component { 
    render() { 
        return (
            <div>
                <Header as='h1'>Hello World!</Header>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
```

At this point, the browser should automatically refresh and show a much simpler page, with just some text that says 'Hello World'. It's not much to look at yet, but it's good to start with as little markup as possible.
